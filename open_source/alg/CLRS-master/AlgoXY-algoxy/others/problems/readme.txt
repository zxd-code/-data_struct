others/appendix/list/problems
  add-digits
    Represent decimal integers in linked-list, and realize add operation for numbers.

  circular
    Cycle detection problem. A speical case is the circular linked-list.

others/problems
  DP (Dynamic programming)
    LCS (longest common sub-sequence) search/LCS

    subset-sum
    The DP subset-sum problem and solution.

  majority-elem (not finished)
    Boyer-moore majority vote problem

  miss-dup
    a list of n non-negative numbers, one number is missed, and one number is duplicated. Provide a linear
    time solution to find the missed and the duplicated numbers.

  number-theory
    linear-congruence
      extended Euclid GCD
        Meet frogs. ACM/ICPC POJ-1061

  parse-rule
    generate all strings following a given pattern.

  stack-min
    Develop a stack with min function to access the minimum element, pop/push/min should operate in O(1) time.

  search
    divide-conquer
      median of two sorted arrays with different lengths.
      k-th element of two sorted arrays with different lengths.
    DFS
      crash-baloon
      ACM/ICPC problem,
    BFS
      Conway slide puzzle.
      link-siblings in a complete binary trees in the same level.
    LCS
      Longest common subsequence.

  subset-sum
      The subset-sum is a typical DP problem, but there exits brute-force DFS solution.

  sort-classes
    This is a topology sort problem.

search
  scan
    majority-vote
      Boyer-moore majority vote problem

    max-sum
      the maximum sum in a list (Jon Bentley, Programming pearls, Column 7)

    palindrome
      The Manacher's algorithm to find the longest palindrome string.

    rain-fill
      Given a elevation map, compute how much water is able to trap after raining.

  binary-search/src
    median.c
      Find the median of two sorted arrays with different length. (Different approach than divide and conquer)
