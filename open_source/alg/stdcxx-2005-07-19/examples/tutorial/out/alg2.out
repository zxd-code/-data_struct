STL generic algorithms -- Searching Algorithms
Test of algorithm find
first vintage leap year is 1972
1995 is position 4 in sequence
Test of algorithm find adjacent
In the text The bookkeeper carefully opened the door
double o in position 5
double k in position 7
double e in position 9
double l in position 21
double o in position 37
Test of algorithm search
substring begins in position 4
Test of max and min algorithms 
largest value was 93
smallest value was 11
The smallest word is best and the largest word is worst
string goody is equal to goody
string good is less than goody
string goody is greater than good
string good is greater than fred
string fred is less than good
End of search algorithms test program
