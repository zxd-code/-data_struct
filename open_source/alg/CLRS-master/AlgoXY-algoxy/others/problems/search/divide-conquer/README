Problems for divide and conquer

1. Find the median of two sorted arrays in O(lg(m_n) time, where m and n are the lengths of the arrays.

   Note:
   there exists another approach to find the meidan, which is essentially variant of binary search
   Refer to AlgoXY/search/src/median.c for details.

2. Find the k-th big element in two sorted arrays in O(lg(m+n)) time, where m, and n are the
   lengths of the arrays.
