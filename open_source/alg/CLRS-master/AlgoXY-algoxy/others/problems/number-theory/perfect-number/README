A perfect number is such an integer, that is equal to the sum of its proper positive factors.
The smallest one is 6 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 3 * 2 * 1.

Given a range n (=2^32 for example), write a program to find the biggest perfect number not greater than n.

Remarks:
There are totally 48 perfect numbers that people have found till now (2014). Each of them is
bound to a Mersenne prime.
