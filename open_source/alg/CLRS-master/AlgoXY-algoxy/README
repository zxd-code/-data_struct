AlgoXY is an open book about elementary
algorithms and data structures. This book doesn't only focus on an
imperative (or procedural) approach, but also includes purely functional
algorithms and data structures.

The PDF version in English can be downloaded from github:

The book in Chinese was published.

Compared to the pdf, the published version contains many important corrections to the contents, equations, and figures.

The original version provides examples in Haskell, C/C++, Python, and Scheme. I started A new branch jvm to provide examples in Java and Scala.
