There are several methods to find the longest palindromic substring.

A palindrome is a string that is symmetric. that S = reverse(S).

The longest palindrome can be given by using suffix tree,
and the suffix tree can be built in linear time (Ukkonen's algorithm for example).
However, the linear time suffix tree construction algorithm isn't a bit complex.
A simple method is to use suffix array instead. But suffix array downgrades
the solution to O(n lg n) time.

Manacher's algorithm is a linear time solution. It scan the string
and reuse the previously result.
