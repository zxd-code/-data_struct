Ideas:
- It's good to introduce the random access sequence problem with MTF
  That, neither purely array nor the linked-list can perform well in
  MTF (search for x, then remove x, and move x to the front).
  Then we can introduced how to implement the random access sequence
    including:
	Numeric representation and binary tree solution;
	Catenable list solution;
  	Finger tree solution;
  After that, we introduce about how to implement linked list in a scenario
  without pointer

- Introduce BWT before MTF

Backlogs:
- Add ANSI C version BST
- Review Python, Scheme BST
- Add C++/C version of RBT
- Add C/C++ version of AVL tree
- Add MTF algorithm
- Add C/C++ version of Binomial heap
