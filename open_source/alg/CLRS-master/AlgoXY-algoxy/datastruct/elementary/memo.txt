The elementary data structures in this books are all introduced. 
We encourage the reader to refer more about data structures as they
are crucial in complex problem solving. Some data structures
are skipped in this book, such as graph, Hash table etc. 

From next chapter, we'll introduce elementary algorithms about searching
and sorting.
