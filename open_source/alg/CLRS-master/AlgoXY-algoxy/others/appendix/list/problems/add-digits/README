Decimal integers can be represented in linked-list. For example 1024 can be represented as '4->2->0->1'.
Thus n = d_m...d_2d_1 can be represented as 'd_1->d_2->...d_m'. Given two linke-lists of integers a, b,
realize add(a, b), which returns their sum in linked-list.
Example: add('5->2', '7->9') produces '2->2->1'.
