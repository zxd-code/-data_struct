There are 3 different problems.

1. Input a list, find the element which occurs most.
   ex: [1,2,2,1,1,3,2,1] ==> (1, 4)
   return the element and the occurrence.

2. Input a list, find the longest substring, which contains the same element
   ex: [1,2,2,2,3,1,1,3,1,1] ==> (2, 3)

3. The Boyer-Moore majority voting problem:
