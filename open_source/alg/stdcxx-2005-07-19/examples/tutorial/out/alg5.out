STL generic algorithms -- algorithms that produce scalar results
There are 3 letter e's 
and 8 vowels in the text:Now is the time to begin
The sum of the first five numbers is 15
The product of the first five numbers is 120
1 2 1 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 
Inner product is 33
any equal? 1
a = b is:0
a = c is:1
a pair-wise-greater_equal b is1
compare everybody to everything 1
compare a to b: 0
compare a to c: 1
End of scalar algorithms test
