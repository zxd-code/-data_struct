Problem:

What's the 1500th number which only contains factors of 2, 3 and 5?
Write a program to find this number, the running time should within 1s.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize array magic and queues Q3, Q5 and Q7
2. Insert 1 into magic.
3. Insert 1*3, 1*5 and 1*7 into Q3, Q5 and Q7 respectively.
4. Let x be the minimum element in Q3, Q5 and Q7.
5. Append x to magic
6. If x was found in:
   Q3 -> append x*3, x*5 and x*7 to Q3, Q5 and Q7. Remove x from Q3.
   Q5 -> append x*5 and x*7 to Q5 and Q7. Remove x from Q5.
   Q7 -> only append x*7 to Q7. Remove x from Q7.
Note: we do not need to append x*3 and x*5 to all lists because they will already be found in another list.
7. Repeat steps 4 - 6 until we¡¯ve found k elements, then return the kth element.
